Poker
=====

Poker game made for Discrete Mathematics

#Instructions
_As a qualifier for everything I'm about to write, this has only been tried on a Macintosh operating system.  It should work fine for most versions of Linux, but I have no idea how to Windows.  The code should work either way, I just don't know the setup process that you would need to do._
* First, you need to download the source code, which can be done by clicking the Download ZIP button to the bottom right of the screen.
* Make sure you know where the downloaded files save to, and make sure they are unzipped.

###Tech-Savvy
_This section is for those of you who are comfortable with Terminal or other console based navigation._
* Open up the console application of your choice, and change directory to the downloaded package.
* Type "make" in the terminal, and it should initiate the compilation process.
* Type ./poker to run the game.

###Everyone Else
* If you're using a Mac, you'll need to open up the Terminal.  You can either:
  * From Finder, hit <Shift><Command><U> to open up the Utilities folder and select Terminal.
  * From Finder, click Go and select Utilities and then find Terminal.
  * Open Spotlight, type Terminal, and then select the Application.
* Once Terminal is opened, type "cd " (that's "cd" followed by a space), and then click and drag the downloaded folder into Terminal.  You should see a green plus sign.  When you drop the files, it will autofill their path location.  Hit <Enter>.
* Now, type "make" into the terminal and hit <Enter>.  It should appear to be doing things.
* Once it has finished making, type "./poker" and hit <Enter>.  The game should now be running.  If not, feel free to send an email to andrew.c.crocker@gmail.com and I will gladly help you sort out any issues you might be having!
